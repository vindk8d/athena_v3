## 🎨 Architecture Visualization

The LangGraph architecture was visualized with the following diagram structure:

### **Main Flow Nodes:**
1. **🔍 Input Interpreter** - Intent classification and context analysis
2. **📋 Planner** - Execution planning and information assessment  
3. **⏰ Time Normalizer** - Natural language time parsing
4. **❓ Clarification** - Generate follow-up questions
5. **⚡ Execution** - Tool execution and result processing
6. **💬 Response Generator** - Final response creation

### **Conditional Edges:**
- **Calendar vs Direct Response** - Routes based on intent
- **Planner Decision Tree** - Determines next processing step

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd python-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Set Environment Variable** 
```bash
export AGENT_TYPE=langgraph
```

### 3. **Run the Server**
```bash
python3 main_langgraph.py
```

### 4. **Generate Visualizations**
```bash
# Create Mermaid diagrams
python3 visualize_langgraph.py

# Generate PNG files (optional - requires mermaid-cli)
./generate_pngs.sh
```

### 5. **Test the Upgrade**
```bash
# Check agent status
curl http://localhost:8000/agent-info

# Switch between agents
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/switch-agent/langgraph
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/switch-agent/regular

# Compare agents
curl http://localhost:8000/agent-comparison
```

## 🔄 Flow Examples

### **Traditional Agent (Before)**
```
User: "Schedule a meeting"
↓
Agent: [Tries to schedule immediately, fails due to missing info]
```

### **LangGraph Agent (After)**
```
User: "Schedule a meeting"
↓
Input Interpreter: [Identifies meeting_request intent]
↓
Planner: [Detects missing time/date information] 
↓
Clarification: "What date and time would work best for you?"
↓
[Awaits user response with context preserved]
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Complete Request**
```bash
POST /process-message
{
  "telegram_message": {
    "text": "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 2 PM",
    ...
  }
}

# Flow: Interpreter → Planner → Time Normalizer → Execution → Response
```

### **Incomplete Request**
```bash
POST /process-message  
{
  "telegram_message": {
    "text": "I need to schedule a meeting",
    ...
  }
}

# Flow: Interpreter → Planner → Clarification → END (awaiting response)
```

### **General Conversation**
```bash
POST /process-message
{
  "telegram_message": {
    "text": "Hello!",
    ...
  }
}

# Flow: Interpreter → Response Generator → END
```

## 📊 Key Improvements

| Aspect | Traditional Agent | LangGraph Agent | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **User Experience** | Basic responses | Natural conversations | 🔥 Major |
| **Time Handling** | Limited parsing | Advanced NLP parsing | 🚀 Massive |
| **Error Handling** | Tool failures | Graceful clarifications | ✨ Significant |  
| **Multi-step Logic** | None | Sophisticated planning | 🎯 Revolutionary |
| **Context Awareness** | Basic | Advanced state tracking | 📈 Substantial |

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Agent type selection
AGENT_TYPE=langgraph  # or "regular"

# OpenAI Configuration  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.3
```

### **Dynamic Switching**
```python
# Switch agents at runtime
POST /switch-agent/langgraph
POST /switch-agent/regular

# Check current configuration
GET /agent-info
```
