```

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t athena-executive-assistant .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env athena-executive-assistant
```

### Render Deployment
1. Connect your repository to Render
2. Set environment variables in Render dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Next.js Integration
Update your main app's `.env.local`:
```env
PYTHON_SERVER_URL=https://your-render-app.onrender.com
```

The Telegram webhook handler automatically:
- Passes user ID and details for executive assistant context
- Passes user's OAuth tokens for calendar access
- Routes colleague messages to the executive assistant
- Handles executive assistant responses with proper user context
- Logs tool execution results for user calendar operations

## üß† Advanced Usage

### Executive Assistant Customization
```python
from agent import ExecutiveAssistantAgent

# Process colleague message for specific user
result = await agent.process_message(
    contact_id="colleague-uuid",
    message="Can I meet with Sarah tomorrow?",
    user_id="user-uuid",
    user_details={"first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Johnson"},
    access_token="user-oauth-token"
)
```

### User-Colleague Memory Management
```python
from memory import MemoryManager

# Get memory for specific user-colleague pair
memory_key = f"{user_id}_{contact_id}"
memory = memory_manager.get_memory(memory_key)

# Add executive assistant message
await memory.add_message(AIMessage(content="I'm Sarah's assistant..."))

# Clear memory for user-colleague pair
memory_manager.clear_memory(memory_key)
```

### User-Centric Tool Development
```python
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
from tools import CalendarToolsInput

class UserSpecificTool(BaseTool):
    name = "user_specific_tool"
    description = "Tool that operates on the authenticated user's data"
    args_schema = CalendarToolsInput
    
    def _run(self, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Tool implementation focused on user data
        return "User-specific result"
```
