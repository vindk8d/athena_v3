# Athena - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Develop Athena, an AI-powered executive assistant that acts on behalf of a single authenticated user to coordinate meetings and manage schedules with their colleagues through intelligent scheduling and seamless calendar integration via Telegram.

### Product Summary
Athena is a conversational AI executive assistant that acts as a proxy for one authenticated user (identified through auth.users.id and user_details table). When colleagues from the contacts table interact with Athena, she introduces herself as the user's executive assistant and coordinates meeting scheduling on their behalf, eliminating the need for colleagues to authenticate their own calendars. This is a single-user system designed to serve one executive and their network of colleagues.

## 2. Target Users

### Primary User
- **The Authenticated Executive**: The single user whose calendar Athena manages and on whose behalf she operates

### Secondary Users
- **User's Colleagues**: All contacts in the system who interact with Athena to schedule meetings with the authenticated user
- **Executive Assistants**: Human assistants who can leverage Athena for enhanced productivity
- **Team Members**: Additional colleagues who may need to coordinate with the authenticated user
