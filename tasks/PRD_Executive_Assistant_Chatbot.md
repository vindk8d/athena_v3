# Athena - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Develop Athena, an AI-powered executive assistant that acts on behalf of authenticated users to coordinate meetings and manage schedules with their colleagues through intelligent scheduling and seamless calendar integration via Telegram.

### Product Summary
Athena is a conversational AI executive assistant that acts as a proxy for authenticated users (identified through auth.users.id and user_details table). When colleagues from the contacts table interact with Athena, she introduces herself as the executive assistant of the user and coordinates meeting scheduling on their behalf, eliminating the need for colleagues to authenticate their own calendars.
